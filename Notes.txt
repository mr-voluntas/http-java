TCP Chat App.

This will be a basic TCP chat app to learn the basics of TCP. This project will server as a basis for more complex projects later on...


Requirments:
  Client:
X - can connect, disconnect and reconnect to the server.
X - can send messages to the server.
X - can recieve messages from other clients.
  - see message history when connecting and reconnecting.
  Server:
  - save messages.
X - relay messages to all connected clients.
X - track connected clients.
  Functions:
  - list connected clients.
  - disconnect.


  TODO:
X - command for disconnecting
X - server to send messages to all connected clients
    - This requires some refactoring to get working.
      - Client: main thread to send messages to the server. nested thread to read incoming messages.
      - Server: create a thread safe list for connected clients, broadcast incomming messages to all other clients. Create a thread to accept clients and a nested thread to broadcast to all connected clients.
  - refactor


  IDEAS:
  - Add in a count for connected clients.
  - Send an object to the server which will create standardised communication.
    - username
    - message
    - command (disconnect | direct message | chat rooms | join chat room | disconnect from chatroom ).
