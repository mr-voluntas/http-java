TCP Chat App.

This will be a basic TCP chat app to learn the basics of TCP. This project will server as a basis for more complex projects later on...


Requirments:
  Client:
X - can connect, disconnect and reconnect to the server.
X - can send messages to the server.
X - can recieve messages from other clients.
  - see message history when connecting and reconnecting.
  Server:
  - save messages.
X - relay messages to all connected clients.
X - track connected clients.
  Functions:
  - list connected clients.
X - disconnect.


  TODO:
X - command for disconnecting
X - server to send messages to all connected clients
    - This requires some refactoring to get working.
      - Client: main thread to send messages to the server. nested thread to read incoming messages.
      - Server: create a thread safe list for connected clients, broadcast incomming messages to all other clients. Create a thread to accept clients and a nested thread to broadcast to all connected clients.
X - refactor
X   - client
X   - server


  IDEAS:
  - Add in a count for connected clients.
X  - Send an object to the server which will create standardised communication (custom protocol)
    - username
    - message
    - command (disconnect | direct message | chat rooms | join chat room | disconnect from chatroom )


Final notes:
  - nice client/server setup which allowed me to play around with learning the basics of TCP.
  - practice implementing some different design patterns (facade, factory and strategy).
  - practice with creating threads to handle tasks in parallel.
  - I did have fun learning about TCP. I think the next project will use TCP again.
  - Maybe during the next project I will aim to learn more advanced TCP or threads? or both...
  - I felt like I changed the design many times, this caused me to keep changing the code.
  - I think before starting a project spend more time planning and thinking about implementation, i could also check with GPT on things I may want to consider and the challenges I may face.
  - I would like to do more stuff with data.. saving, getting, sorting and manipulating.
  - Got boring at the end. I just wanted to finish and move on to something new.

  TLDR:
  - Learnt about TCP and Threads.
  - Learnt some design patterns.
  - Need to plan more.
  - Got bored, need a more interesting concept.
